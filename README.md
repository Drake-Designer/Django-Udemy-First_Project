# 🐍 Django Udemy First Project

**Django Udemy First Project** is a guided practice project I created while following a Django course on Udemy.
  
The main goal is to learn the Django fundamentals by building a simple app that manages monthly coding challenges, with basic routing, templates, and static files.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository is structured as a standard Django project:

- **monthly_challenges app**:  
  Contains the logic for displaying each month's challenge.  
- **Templates**:  
  Reusable HTML files for pages and layouts.  
- **Static files**:  
  CSS stylesheets for layout and design.  

At the moment the project is focused on **routing, templates, and static files**, not on databases or advanced Django features.
